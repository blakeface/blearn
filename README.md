# Blearn... ?

Not sure about the name.

A continuous learning platform... that sounds good.

## ðŸ›  Tools:
* React and React-native
* AWS Cognito
* Serverless!
* AWS Lambda for all DB requests
* RealM for storage
* MongoDB for DB
* Chrome extention and Firefox addon ðŸ¤ž

## ðŸ”® How:
* Memory bank - users will be able to add items to their memory bank either as:
1. a key-value pair
2. a word (will use a dictionary api to recieve definition, part of speech, etc)
3. a single phrase (maybe users want to remember a quote or stand-alone concept)
* Chunking / use of cognitive resources - everyday, users will have access to 5 items from there memory bank. 5 is the magic number since most people only have 4-8 units of working memory
* Repitition - Everyday, one of the 5 items will be replaced. This means each item will be seen for 5 days.

## ðŸ›€ Problems to solve
* Einstellung - users prior knowledge / understanding prevents user from learning something new. How should the app encourage the users to have an open mindset?
